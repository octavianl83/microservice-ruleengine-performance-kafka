# Springboot-drools
Drools is an opensource brms engine
Drools is a Business Rule Management System (BRMS) solution. It provides a rule engine which processes facts and produces output as a result of rules and facts processing. Centralization of business logic makes it possible to introduce changes fast and cheap.

### Drools Basics
We are going to look at basic concepts of Drools:
- Facts – represents data that serves as input for rules
- Working Memory – a storage with Facts, where they are used for pattern matching and can be modified, inserted and removed
- Rule – represents a single rule which associates Facts with matching actions. It can be written in Drools Rule Language in the .drl files or as Decision Table in an excel spreadsheet
- Knowledge Session – it holds all the resources required for firing rules; all Facts are inserted into session, and then matching rules are fired
- Knowledge Base – represents the knowledge in the Drools ecosystem, it has the information about the resources where Rules are found, and also it creates the Knowledge Session
- Module – A module holds multiple Knowledge Bases which can hold different sessions
### Springboot configuration
#### POM file
 
 ```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.drools</groupId>
<artifactId>drools-core</artifactId>
<version>6.4.0.Final</version>
</dependency><!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.drools/drools-compiler -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.drools</groupId>
<artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
<version>6.4.0.Final</version>
</dependency><!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kie/kie-api -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.kie</groupId>
<artifactId>kie-api</artifactId>
<version>6.4.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
 ```
 #### rule file
 - create a folder inside src/main/resources
 - create a file that has .drl extension
 #### ksession
 - create a folder named `META-INF`
 - create a file named `kmodule.xml`
 - copy and paste the following code
 ```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kmodule xmlns="http://jboss.org/kie/6.0.0/kmodule">
   <kbase name="rules" packages="com.rule">
        <ksession name="rulesSession"/>
    </kbase>
</kmodule>
```
#### kieContainer bean
- Create a bean inside main class like following
```xml
	@Bean
	public KieContainer kieContainer() {
		return KieServices.Factory.get().getKieClasspathContainer();
	}
```
#### trigger rules
- write service layer in the following format
```xml
	public Product getProductDiscount(Product product, Customer customer) {
		KieSession kieSession = kieContainer.newKieSession("rulesSession");
		kieSession.insert(product);
		kieSession.setGlobal("ProductService", this);
		kieSession.fireAllRules();
		kieSession.dispose();
		return product;
	}
```
`Note:` while instantiating kieSession we've passed kieSession name as `rulesSession` which was created inside `kmodule.xml` file previously and we've passed `ProductService` as `ProductService` through the session to use this isnside .drl file.
#### .drl file
- a .drl file has three major parts
	1. package declaration
	```xml
	package com.rule
	```
	2. file/class importing
	```xml
	import com.msi.model.Product
	import com.msi.service.ProductService
	import com.msi.model.Customer
	```
	3. variable declaration
	```xml
	global 	ProductService ProductService
	```
	`Note:` We've passed ProductService as `ProductService` 
	
	4. rules
	
```xml
rule "Offer for Diamond"
	when 
		productObject: Product(type=="diamond")
	then
		productObject.setDiscount(15);
	end
	
rule "Offer for Gold"
	when 
		productObject: Product(type=="gold")
	then
		productObject.setDiscount(25);
	end
	
rule "Offer for Gold"
	when 
		productObject: Product(type=="gold")
		customerObj: Customer()
	then
	  if(customerObj.getAge()>21){
	  ProductService.printMsg();
	  }
		productObject.setDiscount(27);		
	end
```
